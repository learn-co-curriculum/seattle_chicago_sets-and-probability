    "# Inferential Statistics\n",
    "In our mod 1 project, we began looking at datasets (i.e. movie info) and made various observations. We considered the data as if we were looking at a complete picture of the movie industries. We introduced a few descriptive statistics such as measures of central tendency and outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, often in our work as data scientists, rarely will we have a dataset that encompases an entire population.  Instead, we will look at a sample of the population and make inferences about the greater population.  let's take a quick tour into inferential statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider these examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A zoologist wanting to know the typical lifespan of a Siberian tiger\n",
    "- A cosmologist wanting to know the mass of a normal white dwarf star\n",
    "- A businesswoman wanting to know how many M&M's her customers should expect to find in their Party Size bags\n",
    "- A botanist wanting to know how tall California redwoods usually grow\n",
    "\n",
    "The zoologist could, in principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- keep track of every currently existing Siberian tiger;\n",
    "- record their (more or less) exact ages at their moments of death;\n",
    "- add up those ages and divide by the number of tigers to calculate an average lifespan\n",
    "\n",
    "––But only in principle. In all of these situations, there is no realistic or practical opportunity to check each relevant data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can do, however, is to check some of the data points we want to check. That is, we'll draw a sample of data from our population of interest. We can then use the techniques of descriptive statistics to characterize our sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this help? The hope, of course, is that our sample will be representative of the population as a whole, which would justify our using facts about the sample to infer things about the population as a whole. But naturally we'll expect a certain amount of error: If I take the mean of a sample, $\\bar{x}$ and project it as an estimate of the mean of the whole population, $\\mu$, the estimate is bound to be imperfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics makes all this precise. \n",
    "\n",
    "This intro was adapted from Peter Norvig's pytude deck found [here]( https://github.com/gadamico/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Probability.ipynb). It is awesome. Check out the entire deck when you have a free moment."
